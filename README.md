Examples of connecting Java to native libraries using [JNR FFI](https://github.com/jnr/jnr-ffi).
It contains only a basic example for now, but more will be added soon.

### Building
You will need **JDK 11** or higher to build the projects. Execute the Gradle task
`run` for any project to build and run it. The project name will be same as 
the directory containing it. For example, execute the following to build and run `basics`:

```
./gradlew basics:run
```
